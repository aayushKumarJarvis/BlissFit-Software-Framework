===========================

A Prototype application which would first generate a random user-profile in JSON format. This profile will replicate itself
with 100k different random profiles. 

These random profiles would be stored in a NoSQL database, MongoDB in this case. Simple analytics would be generated would 
be genrated on this autogenerated dataset.

I would try to convert this model into a real-time engine which could process streams of input data from Arduino and MSP.

Plan is to render these analytics on a Android App. Since I am completely unaware of Android Programming, so lets see when 
can I pull this stuff. . .
